Advent of Code 2023 - Python Solutions
======================================


Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code 2023 event! This project contains my solutions in Python for the daily challenges presented in the Advent of Code event.

About Advent of Code
--------------------

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released, covering a variety of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills. Participants around the world engage in solving these puzzles and share their solutions.

Project Structure
-----------------

The repository is organized with a separate folder for each day of the Advent of Code event. Inside each folder, you will find the Python solutions for the respective day's challenge. Additionally, there may be an input file specific to each day, which can be obtained from the Advent of Code website.

How to Use
----------

1.  Navigate to the folder corresponding to the desired day.
2.  Download the input file for that day from the provided Advent of Code link.
3.  Run the Python script using the following command:


`python solution.py`

Disclaimer
----------

These solutions are my personal interpretations of the Advent of Code challenges and may not be the most optimized or elegant solutions. They serve as a learning exercise and a way to explore different problem-solving approaches.

Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt the code to suit your needs. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding, and best of luck with Advent of Code 2023!
