Calibration Values Sum - Advent of Code 2023
============================================

============================================

Problem Statement
-----------------

The task involves processing a calibration document to recover calibration values. The document has been tampered with by a young Elf, making it challenging for the Elves to read the values. Each line of the document originally contained a specific calibration value, recoverable by combining the first and last digits to form a two-digit number. The goal is to find the sum of all these calibration values.

Input
-----

The input for this problem can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1/input). Download the input file and save it as "input.txt" in the same directory as the program.

How to Run the Code
-------------------

Ensure you have a Python interpreter installed on your system. You can run the program using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:


`python main.py`

This assumes your Python source code file is named "calibration.py." Adjust the filename if needed.

Implementation Details
----------------------

The Python script reads each line from the "input.txt" file, extracts the first and last digits from each line, and combines them to form a two-digit calibration value. The sum of all these calibration values is then calculated and displayed.

Notes
-----

-   The program uses the `open` function to read from the input file.
-   Make sure the input file is in the correct format and contains the necessary data.
-   Check for any runtime errors and ensure that the input file is accessible.
